3. As a User, I want to edit or delete tasks to keep my list organized and up to date.
4. As a User, I want to filter or sort my tasks by due date, priority, or completion status to find what I need quickly.
5. As a User, I want to view my tasks grouped under projects so that I can keep personal and work tasks separate.
