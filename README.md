## About

### Description and Purpose

TaskFlow is a full-stack web app that helps users stay organized by creating and managing projects and tasks. Each project includes customizable settings and multiple members, while tasks can be sorted, filtered, and updated in real time.

Built with Express.js and PostgreSQL, TaskFlow‚Äôs backend supports full CRUD operations, automatic task generation for new projects, and robust data validation. The goal of the project is to make task management more efficient, clear, and collaborative.

### Inspiration

TaskFlow was inspired by tools like Trello and Notion, but reimagined as a custom-built full-stack app. The goal was to create a clean, minimal project manager that demonstrates database relationships, RESTful API design, and backend automation ‚Äî while remaining practical for real-world use.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: Picoss.css, React, Context to an API, fetch request

Backend: Node.js and Express.js, PostgreSQL ,pg, dotenv 

## Features

### Full CRUD

Users can create, view, edit, and delete both projects and tasks.
Each action updates the database in real time through RESTful API endpoints.

### Data Generation - to be reviewed

When a new project is created, TaskFlow automatically adds a few starter tasks such as:

‚ÄúWelcome to TaskFlow‚Äù

‚ÄúInvite teammates‚Äù

‚ÄúSet your first milestone‚Äù

This feature demonstrates backend event-based automation.

### Data validation and Error handling

Before updates are saved, data is validated ‚Äî for example:

Tasks cannot be created with a due date in the past.

Projects must have a title.
If invalid data is sent, the backend responds with clear error messages using custom Express middleware.

### Sliding UI

The frontend includes modals for adding or editing tasks, which appear as overlays on the same page.
This allows users to perform quick edits without losing context ‚Äî a user-friendly single-page interaction.

### filtering and sorting

Users can filter and sort tasks by:

Due date

Priority

Status (Complete / Incomplete)
These operations occur client-side for responsiveness, with options to extend filtering to the backend via query parameters.
